                            Financial accounting is roughly defined as the practices and processes by which financial transactions are recorded, monitored, analysed and managed.  Professional accountants play a direct role in the financial performance and efficiency of the organisations and individuals they work for.  Accountants take charge of all key financial matters, including revenue analysis, profit and loss management, debts, credits and all business expenses.  Along with ensuring that the business meets all essential tax obligations, accountants are also directly involved in minimising expenditure, 
                            maximising income and bolstering profitability.</p>
